## Understand the task

Alejandre manages a venue for business conferences. Her parent company, "BudgetEase" wants to hire you to develop a website so BudgetEase customers can price their conference events easily.

The application's requirements include allowing users to select and price the rooms in the conference center, add-on selections, like microphones and projectors, and meals for a given number of guests.

The _BudgetEase_ conference expense planner features will include:

* A dynamic user interface that updates in real time based on user selections
* Components for venue selection, add-ons, and meal options
* Redux integration using Redux Toolkit to manage state changes
* Redux slices to manage different section states
* Display selected items and their costs with a table in a pop-up window
* Calculate and display subtotals and total costs based on user selections

### **Learning objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create React components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting.
* Manage states with hooks: Implement React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks. You will use hooks to manage component-level state and control the visibility of elements.
* Integrate Redux: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
* Render dynamic data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. You will map over arrays to generate lists of components.
* Handle events using conditional rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.

### **Project tasks**

1. Setup the project environment
2. Review the structure of the ConferenceEvent.jsx component
3. Review the code for the venue module
4. Combine Redux with components to manage updates and state changes
5. Add logic to calculate subtotals and total cost
6. Make a dynamic table to show chosen products, displaying the item name, unit cost, quantity, and overall costs for that item
7. Create a web design for a comfortable user experience
8. Deploy your website to a public hosting service

### **In this project, you:**

* Created function components
* Review the structure of the ConferenceEvent.jsx component
* Used Redux Toolkit slices to manage different parts of your application's states
* Implemented Redux actions, reducers and the Redux store to increment and decrement stored values and dynamically display those values.
* Calculated and displayed costs using arrays and the map() function to iterate over the arrays
* Made a dynamic table to show selected products, displaying the item names, unit cost, quantity, and subtotal for that item
